# DiscordBot
NOTE: The functionality requires a config.json file in the format...
{
	"prefix": // choice of prefix, usually "!";
	"token": // personal token of your created Bot
	"giphyKey": // key for Giphy API, obtained on Giphy Developer
}

This bot connects to the giphy API to allow users in a Discord server to search for a gif using the command "(prefix)gif (search)". In addition to this, other functionalities include server management for managers.
